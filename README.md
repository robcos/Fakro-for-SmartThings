# Fakro-for-SmartThings
SmartThings Device Handlers for Fakro Skylight Windows. Unfortunately this is a tricky process which is recommended for peope familiar with GitHub

**Disclaimer: I don't have time unfortunaly to provide support on this Device Handler**

**Warning: This procedure will remove your window from your Fakro remote control. Please see the Fakro manual for how to restore that functionality if you want that. You will only be able to use the window through your phone*

In order to install in the app:

* Open the SmartThings app
* Tap +
* Tap "Device"
* Tap "Scan nearby"

On your Fakro window:
* Press the P button multiple times until it turns on
* Check the app until the window is installed

Now check out this video for how to install the device handler
